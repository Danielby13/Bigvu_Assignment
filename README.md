# Bigvu Assignment

The task I took was to build a server, when the server recevie POST request with web address (json format)
it will screenshot the site and convert into a 10 seconds video.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

```

npm install (to install all the dependencies needed to run this task)
cd to where clone file is placed
node index.js
```
The library i used to make the video based on ffmpeg so you have to install this program before running this task.
